# NTP Binding
 
The NTP binding is used for displaying the local date and time based update from an NTP server.
 
## Supported Things
 
This binding supports one ThingType: ntp
 
## Discovery
 
Discovery is used to place one default item in the inbox as convenient way to add a Thing for the local time.
 
## Binding Configuration
 
The binding has no configuration options, all configuration is done at Thing level.
 
## Thing Configuration
 
The things has a few configuration options:

| Option |  Description  |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------- |
| hostname | NTP host server, e.g. nl.pool.ntp.org |
| refreshInterval | Interval that new time updates are posted to the eventbus in seconds |
| refreshNtp | Number of updates between querying the NTP server (e.g. with refreshinterval = 60 (seconds) and refreshNtp = 30 the NTP server is queried each half hour. |
| timeZone | Timezone, can be left blank for using the default system one |
| locale | Locale, can be left blank for using the default system one |

 
## Channels
 
The ntp binding has only one channel  `dateTime`

```
ntp:ntp:demo  [ hostname="nl.pool.ntp.org", refreshInterval=60, refreshNtp=30 ]
