# Belkin Wemo Binding

This binding integrates the [Belkin WeMo Family](http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/c/home-automation/).
The integration happens either through the WeMo-Link bridge, which acts as an IP gateway to the ZigBee devices or through WiFi connection to standalone devices.

## Supported Things

The WeMo Binding supports the Socket, Insight, Lightswitch, Motion and Maker devices, as well as the WeMo-Link bridge with WeMo LED bulbs.

## Discovery

The WeMo devices are discovered through UPnP discovery service in the network. Devices will show up in the inbox and can be easily added as Things.

## Binding Configuration

The binding does not need any special configuration

## Thing Configuration

For manual Thing configuration, one needs to know the UUID of a certain WeMo device.
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like
```
wemo:socket:Switch1 [udn="Socket-1_0-221242K11xxxxx"]
```
For a WeMo Link bridge and paired LED Lights, please use the following Thing definition

```
Bridge wemo:bridge:Bridge-1_0-231445B01006A0 [udn="Bridge-1_0-231445B010xxxx"] {
MZ100 94103EA2B278xxxx [ deviceID="94103EA2B278xxxx" ]
MZ100 94103EA2B278xxxx [ deviceID="94103EA2B278xxxx" ]
}
```



## Channels

Devices support some of the following channels:

| Channel Type ID | Item Type    | Description  |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------|----------------- |------------- |
| motionDetection | Switch | On if motion is detected, off otherwise. (Motion Sensor only) |
| lastMotionDetected | DateTime | Representing the Date and Time when the last motion was detected. (Motion Sensor only) |
| state | Switch       | This channel controls the actual binary State of a Device or represents Motion Detection. |
| lastChangedAt | DateTime | Representing the Date and Time the device was last turned on or of. |
| lastOnFor | Number       | Time in seconds an Insight device was last turned on for. |
| onToday   | Number       | Time in seconds an Insight device has been switched on today.   |
| onTotal   | Number       | Time in seconds an Insight device has been switched on totally. |
| timespan  | Number       | Time in seconds over which onTotal applies. Typically 2 weeks except first used. |
| averagePower | Number    | Average power consumption in Watts. 
| currentPower | Number    | Current power consumption of an Insight device. 0 if switched off. |
| energyToday | Number     | Energy in Wh used today. |
| energyTotal | Number     | Energy in Wh used in total. |
| standbyLimit | Number    | Minimum energy draw in W to register device as switched on (default 8W, configurable via WeMo App). |
| brightness   | Number    | Brightness of a WeMo LED. |
