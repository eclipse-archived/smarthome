/**
 * Class to implement the BlueGiga command <b>setAdvParameters</b>.
 * <p>
 * This command is used to set the advertising parameters. Example: If the minimum
 * advertisement interval is 40ms and the maximum advertisement interval is 100ms then the
 * real advertisement interval will be mostly the middle value (70ms) plus a randomly added
 * 20ms delay, which needs to be added according to the Bluetooth specification.

 * This class provides methods for processing BlueGiga API commands.
