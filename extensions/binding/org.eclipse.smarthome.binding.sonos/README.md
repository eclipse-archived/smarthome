# Sonos Binding

This binding integrates the [Sonos Multi-Room Audio system](http://www.sonos.com).

**Attention:** 
You might run into trouble if your control system (the binding) is in another subnet than your Sonos device. 
Sonos devices make use of multicast which in most cases needs additional router configuration outside of a single subnet.   
If you observe communication errors (COMMUNICATION_ERROR/not registered), you might need to configure your router to increase the TTL of the packets send by your Sonos device. 
This happens because of a TTL=1 for ALIVE packets send by Sonos devices, resulting in dropped packets after one hop.

## Supported Things

All available Sonos (playback) devices are supported by this binding. This includes the One, Play:1, Play:3, Play:5, Connect, Connect:Amp, Playbar, Playbase, Beam and Sub. The Bridge and Boost are not supported, but these devices do only have an auxiliary role in the Sonos network and do not have any playback capability. All supported Sonos devices are registered as an audio sink in the framework.

When being defined in a \*.things file, the specific thing types One, PLAY1, PLAY3, PLAY5, PLAYBAR, PLAYBASE, Beam, CONNECT and CONNECTAMP should be used.

Please note that these thing types are case sensitive (you need to define them in upper case).

## Discovery

The Sonos devices are discovered through UPnP in the local network and all devices are put in the Inbox. Beware that all Sonos devices have to be added to the local Sonos installation as described in the Sonos setup procedure, e.g. through the Sonos Controller software or smartphone app.

## Binding Configuration

The binding has the following configuration options, which can be set for "binding:sonos":

| Parameter   | Name             | Description                                                              | Required |
|-------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| opmlUrl     | OPML Service URL | URL for the OPML/tunein.com service                                      | no       |
| callbackUrl | Callback URL     | URL to use for playing notification sounds, e.g. http://192.168.0.2:8080 | no       |

## Thing Configuration

The Sonos Thing requires the UPnP UDN (Unique Device Name) as a configuration value in order for the binding to know how to access it.
All the Sonos UDN have the "RINCON_000E58D8403A0XXXX" format.
Additionally, a refresh interval, used to poll the Sonos device, can be specified (in seconds).
You can use the `notificationVolume` property for setting a default volume (in percent) to be used to play notifications.
In the thing file, this looks e.g. like

```
Thing sonos:PLAY1:1 [udn="RINCON_000E58D8403A0XXXX", refresh=60, notificationVolume=25]
```

## Channels

The devices support the following channels:

## Audio Support

All supported Sonos devices are registered as an audio sink in the framework.
Audio streams are treated as notifications, i.e. they are fed into the `notificationsound` channel.
The `notificationsound` channel change the volume of the audio sink to the value defined in the `notificationVolume` property of the thing and restores it after finished playing.
Note that the Sonos binding has a limit of 20 seconds for notification sounds.
Any sound that is longer than that will be cut off.

URL audio streams (e.g. an Internet radio stream) are an exception and do not get sent to the `notificationsound` channel.
Instead, these will be sent to the `playuri` channel.
