Another year has passed and [EclipseCon Europe 2018](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/) took place in Ludwigsburg, Germany - and with it, our second edition of a colocated [Smart Home Day](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2018/smarthome).<!--more-->

The Smart Home Day was hosted by the [openHAB Foundation](https://www.openhabfoundation.org/) with [Bosch SI](https://www.bosch-si.com), [codecentric](https://www.codecentric.de) and [Deutsche Telekom](https://www.qivicon.com/en/) as sponsors.

Just like last year, the day was all about [Eclipse SmartHome](https://www.eclipse.org/smarthome/), its solutions and especially its community.
Not only were there again very interesting talks about the internals of Eclipse SmartHome and some of its new features. The audience also learned about cool projects that have been realised with it. The program concluded with a panel discussion about the pros and cons of different build and IDE approaches for the project - giving good insights into Maven, Tycho and Bnd.

As the community is spread over the whole world and not everyone had the chance to come to Ludwigsburg, the Smart Home Day presentations were professionally recorded this year by the [CCC Video Operations Center](https://c3voc.de/). They did an awesome job and not only provided us high-quality recordings, but also had all of them uploaded and shared [a few minutes after the event was over](https://twitter.com/kaikreuzer/status/1053999503471243264).

A big thanks to everyone who has attended the event as well as to all the speakers that helped making the day a great success! There was a lot of very positive feedback on the talks and it always makes a very special atmosphere to have so many passionate community members together at one place. While we will try to repeat doing such events in future, everybody should feel encouraged to organise local meet-ups or other types of events around their favorite project - it is absolutely worth the efforts!
