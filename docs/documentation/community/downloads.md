# Downloads

## Source Code

The source code of Eclipse SmartHome™ is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome).

## Binary Artifacts

Since Eclipse SmartHome™ is not a solution by itself, we do not offer any ready-to-run downloadable artifact. The binary build of Eclipse SmartHome [consists out of OSGi bundles](../features/index.html) that are provided through p2 and Maven repositories.

Besides the runtime bundles, Eclipse SmartHome comes with the "Designer", which is an Eclipse RCP application. The Designer is a tool for textual configuration of a runtime. You only need it, if your solution makes use of the [textual configuration support](../features/dsl.html) of Eclipse SmartHome.
