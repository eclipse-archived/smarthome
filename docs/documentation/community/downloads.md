# Downloads

## Source Code

The source code of Eclipse SmartHome is available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/eclipse/smarthome).

## p2 Repositories

Since Eclipse SmartHome is not a solution by itself, we do not offer any ready-to-run downloadable artifact. The binary build of Eclipse SmartHome [consists out of OSGi bundles](../features/index.html) that are provided through a p2 repository.

You can find nightly snapshot builds of the Eclipse SmartHome features and bundles at [http://download.eclipse.org/smarthome/updates-nightly/](http://download.eclipse.org/smarthome/updates-nightly/) and the latest stable versions at [http://download.eclipse.org/smarthome/updates-stable/](http://download.eclipse.org/smarthome/updates-stable/).

## Designer Builds

The Designer is the tool for textual configuration of your runtime. You will only need it, if your solution makes use of the [textual configuration support](../features/dsl.html) of Eclipse SmartHome.
