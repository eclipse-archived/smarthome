Notes
===
The following notes should collect some tips and tricks for the development for and with the Eclipse SmartHome framework.

Maven Bundle Plugin
---

The Eclipse SmartHome framework follows the Manifest first approach and Tycho is been used to build eclipse-plugins using maven.
Sometimes it could be useful to use the maven-bundle-plugin (and so the bnd tools) to inspect a generated manifest file and compare this one with the one that is used by Tycho (e.g. to identify missing imports, etc.).
The manifest generation could be triggered by:

    mvn bundle:manifest -DniceManifest=true

The "nice manifest" option will add line breaks after every imported package.
Now you can have a look at the manifest that would be generated by the bndtool using:

    cat target/classes/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
