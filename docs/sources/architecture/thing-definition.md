## Channels

A channel describes a specific functionality of a thing and can be linked to an item. So the basic information is, which command types the channel can handle and which state it sends to the linked item. This can be specified by the accepted item type. Inside the thing type description XML file a list of channels can be referenced. The channel type definition is specified on the same level as the thing type definition. That way channels can be reused in different things.

The following XML snippet shows a thing type definition with 2 channels and one referenced channel types:

```xml 
<thing-type id="thingTypeID">
    <label>Sample Thing</label>
    <description>Some sample description</description>
    <channels>
      <channel id="switch" typeId="switch" />
      <channel id="targetTemperature" typeId="temperatureActuator" />
    </channels>
</thing-type>
<channel-type id="temperatureActuator" advanced="true">
    <item-type>Number</item-type>
    <label>Temperature</label>
    <category>Temperature</category>
    <tags>
      <tag>weather</tag>
    </tags>
    <state min="12" max="30" step="0.5" pattern="%d °C" readOnly="false">
    </state>
</channel-type>
```

The `advanced` property indicates if this channel is either a basic or a more specific functionality of the thing. If `advanced` is set to `true` a user inteface mide hide this channel by default. The default value is `false` and will be taken if the `advanced` attribute is not specified. Espacially for complex devices with a lot of channels, only a small set of channels - the most important ones - should be shown to the user to reduce complexity. If a channel should be declared as `advanced` depends on the device and can be decided by the binding developer. If a functionality is rarley used it should be better marked as `advanced`.

In the following sections the declaration and semantics of tags, state descriptions and channel categories will be explained in more detail. For a complete sample of the thing types XML file and a full list of possible configuration options please see the [XML Configuration Guide](configuration.md).

### Default Tags

The XML definition of a ThingType allows to assign default tags to channels. All items bound to this channel will automatically be tagged with these default tags. The following snippet shows an alarm tag definition:

```xml 
<tags>
    <tag>weather</tag>
</tags>
```

### State Description

The state description allows to specify restrictions and additional information for the state of an item, that is linked to the channel. Some configuration options are only valid for specific item types. The following XML snippet shows the definition for a temperature actuator channel:

```xml 
<state min="12" max="30" step="0.5" pattern="%d °C" readOnly="false"></state>
```

The attributes `min` and `max` can only be declared for channel with the item type `Number`. It defines the range of the numeric value. The Java data type is a BigDecimal. For example user interfaces can create sliders with an appropriate scale based on this information. The `step` attribute can be declared for `Number` and `Dimmer` items and defines what is the minimal step size that can be used. The `readonly` attribute can be used for all item types and defines if the state of an item can be changed. For all sensors the `readonly` attribute should be set to `false`. The `pattern` attribute can be used for `Number` and  `String` items. It gives user interface a hint how to render the item. The format of the pattern must be compliant to the [Java Number Format](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/numberformat.html). The pattern can be localized (see also [Internationalization](internationalization.md))

Some channels might have only a limited and countable set of states. These states can be specified as options. A `String` item must be used as item type. The following XML snippet defines a list of predefined state options:

```xml 
<state readOnly="true">
    <options>
        <option value="HIGH">High Pressure</option>
        <option value="MEDIUM">Medium Pressure</option>
        <option value="LOW">Low Pressure</option>
    </options>
</state>
```

The user interface can use these values to render labels for values or to provide a selection of states, when the channel is writable. The option labels can also be localized.

### Channel Categories

The channel type definition allows to specify a category. Together with the definition of the `readOnly` attribute in the state description, user interfaces get an idea how to render an item for this channel. A binding should classify each channel into one of the existing categories. This is a list of all predefined categories with their usual accssible mode and the according item type:

| Category      | Accessible Mode | Item Type              |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Alarm         | R, RW           | Switch                 |
| Battery       | R               | Switch, Number         |
| Blinds        | RW              | Rollershutter          |
| ColorLight    | RW              | Color                  |

| Motion        | R               | Switch                 |
| MoveControl   | RW              | String                 |
| Player        | RW              | Player                 |
| PowerOutlet   | RW              | Switch                 |
| Pressure      | R               | Number                 |
| Rain          | R               | Switch, Number         |
| Recorder      | RW              | String                 |
| Smoke         | R               | Switch                 |
| SoundVolume   | R, RW           | Number                 |
| Switch        | RW              | Switch                 |
| Temperature   | R, RW           | Number                 |
| Water         | R               | Switch, Number         |
| Wind          | R               | Number                 |
| Window        | R, RW           | String, Switch         |
| Zoom          | RW              | String                 |
R=Read, RW=Read/Write

The accessible mode indicates whether a category could have `read only` flag configured to true or not. For example the `Motion` category can be used for sensors only, so `read only` can not be false. Temperature can be either measured or adjusted, so the accessible mode is R and RW, which means the read only flag can be `true` or `false`. In addition categories are realated to specific item types. For example the 'Energy' category can only be used for `Number` items. But `Rain` could be either expressed as Switch item, where it only indicates if it rains or not, or as `Number`, which gives information about the rain intensity.

The list of categories may not be complete and not every device will fit into one of these categories. It is possible to define own categories. If the category is widely used, the list of predefined categories can be extended. Moreover not all user interfaces will support all categories. It is more important to specify the `read only` information and state information, so that default controls can be rendered, even if the category is not supported.

### Channel Groups

Some devices might have a lot of channels. There are also complex devices like a multi-channel actuator, which is installed inside the switchboard, but controls switches in other rooms. Therefore channel groups can be used to group a set of channels together into one logical block. A thing can only have direct channels or channel groups, but not both.

Inside the thing types XML file channel groups can be defined like this:

```xml 
<thing-type id="multiChannelSwitchActor">
    <!-- ... -->
    <channel-groups>
        <channel-group id="switchActor1" typeId="switchActor" />
        <channel-group id="switchActor2" typeId="switchActor" />
    </channel-groups>
    <!-- ... -->
</thing-type>    
```

The channel group type is defined on the same level as the thing types and channel types. The group type must have a label and an optional description. More over the list of contained channels must be specified:

```xml
<channel-group-type id="switchActor">
    <label>Switch Actor</label>
    <description>This is a single switch actor with a switch channel</description>
    <channels>
        <channel id="switch" typeId="switch" />
    </channels>
</channel-group-type> 
```

When a thing will be created for a thing type with channel groups, the channel UID will contain the group ID in the last segment divided by a hash (#). If an Item should be linked to channel within a group, the channel UID would be `binding:multiChannelSwitchActor:myDevice:switchActor1#switch` for the XML example before.
