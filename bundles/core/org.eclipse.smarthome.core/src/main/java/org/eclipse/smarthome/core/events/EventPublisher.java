/**
 * The {@link EventPublisher} is a service which is used to send commands or status
 * updates through the <i>Eclipse SmartHome</i> event bus.
 * <p>
 * The event bus belongs to the <i>Eclipse SmartHome</i> core and is used as major
 * intercommunication mechanism between the different modules. The modules itself
 * have usually no concrete dependencies between each other so that their dependencies
 * keep non-invasive (loose-coupling).
 * <p>
 * An event is always sent under a specific topic starting with the prefix
 * {@link EventConstants#TOPIC_PREFIX} (namespace) followed by a sub-topic.
 * A listener can subscribe to a topic and receive the information subscribed to.
 * The simplest way of receiving events is to extend the {@link AbstractEventSubscriber}
 * which already subscribes to the according <i>Eclipse SmartHome</i> topics and which
 * already implements the {@link EventSubscriber} listener interface.
